// - n_buckets_in_segment : power of two number,  this is size of segment, each time
//   table is resized, number of segments doubles up, to a maximum of max_segments.
// - add_range is the number of buckets searched in order to find a free bucket for
//   displacement closer to base bucket.  When no free buckets within  add_range of
//   initial bucket, table is resized.
// - hop_range specifies the range of which buckets that isn't base bucket must fall
//   within, if range is 64, bitmap_t must be able to hold 64 bits, for range of 32,
//   uint32_t is sufficient. hop_range should consider the size of cache line.
// - User must provide a  hash function  that hashes key type into something of type
//   key_t, this type can be changed above.
// - max_tries specifies how many times hs_get  will try to search through its range
//   for a consistent state.
